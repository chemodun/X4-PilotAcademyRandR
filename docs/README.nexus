[size=3][u][b]Training Procedure[/b][/u][/size]
[list]
[*] After the [b]Academy[/b]'s location is set, the Player can create the first [b]Wing[/b].
[*] Once a [b]Wing[/b] is created, any number of [b]Wingmen[/b] can be added to it.
[*] Immediately after [b]Wing[/b] creation, a special order will search for the best trade deal to increase rank and relations.
[*] After each sale, the ship pilot's current rank will be checked against the target level.
[*] If the rank is reached, the presence of [b]Cadets[/b] at the [b]Academy[/b] station will be checked, and the first available candidate will be transferred to the ship.
[*] If no [b]Cadets[/b] are detected, the [b]Auto Hire[/b] option will be checked. If enabled, a new [b]Cadet[/b] will be hired for the ship, and the appropriate fee will be paid.
[*] If no [b]Cadets[/b] are available and [b]Auto Hire[/b] is disabled, the script will repeat these checks in 3 minutes.
[*] Otherwise, the [b]Trained Pilot[/b] on the ship will be swapped with a [b]Cadet[/b] and then moved to the [b]Academy[/b] station.
[*] If the [b]Assign[/b] option is not set to [b]Manual[/b], and the last assignment turn was finished at least 2 minutes ago, the [b]Auto Assign[/b] procedure will be initiated.
[*] Based on the [b]Assign[/b] setting, a ship with a pilot who has a lower rank (and is below the target rank level) will be selected.
[*] If such a ship is found, the [b]Trained Pilot[/b] will be assigned as its pilot, and the existing pilot will be transferred to the [b]Academy[/b] station as a new [b]Cadet[/b].
[*] Every 3 minutes, the [b]Auto Assign[/b] procedure will repeat to check for available [b]Trained Pilots[/b].
[/list]
[size=3][u][b]Usage[/b][/u][/size]

After installation, a new icon will appear on the left menu panel. Clicking it opens the [b]Academy[/b] management window.

The [b]Academy[/b] window has three types of tabs:
[list]
[*] [b]Academy Settings[/b]
[*] [b]Cadets and Pilots[/b]
[*] Wings management tabs, including [b]Add New Wing[/b]
[/list]
[size=3][u][i]Academy Settings Tab[/i][/u][/size]

The [b]Academy Settings[/b] tab includes controls for location, target skill level, auto-hiring, and auto-assigning [b]Trained Pilots[/b].

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/initial_screen.png[/img]

[size=3][u]Academy Location[/u][/size]

The [b]Academy[/b] uses an assigned Player-owned or other faction's station as living quarters for [b]Cadets[/b] and [b]Trained Pilots[/b].

In the early game, when the Player may not own any stations, other factions' wharfs, shipyards, or trading stations can be used, depending on the Player's reputation with them.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/locations_other_factions.png[/img]

Any available station can be chosen.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/selected_location_other_faction.png[/img]

If a non-Player-owned station is selected, the Player will be charged a daily rental fee.

If the Player owns any stations, other factions' stations will not appear in the location list.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/locations_Player_owned.png[/img]

Any Player-owned station can be selected, though using the HQ is not recommended to avoid interference with terraforming projects.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/selected_location_Player_owned.png[/img]

[size=2][u][i]Resetting the Academy Location[/i][/u][/size]

At any time, the Player can reset the [b]Academy[/b] location by pressing the button with the current station info. A new station can then be selected from the dropdown.
After pressing the [b]Update[/b] button, the location will be changed, and [b]Cadets[/b] and [b]Trained Pilots[/b] will be moved to the new [b]Academy[/b] station.

[size=3][u]Auto Hire Cadets[/u][/size]

After completing the appropriate research, the Player can enable the auto-hire feature.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/auto_hire_options.png[/img]

This will automatically hire new [b]Cadets[/b] from the selected factions, and the Player will be charged the standard hiring fees.

[size=3][u]Auto Assign Trained Pilots[/u][/size]

Once researched, the Player can enable auto-assign in the [b]Academy[/b] interface. This allows the Player to set priorities for assigning pilots who have reached the target rank, based on ship role and size.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/auto_assign_options.png[/img]

When auto-assign is active, [b]Trained Pilots[/b] will replace existing pilots on the Player's ships who have a lower rank than the target. The replaced pilots will be reassigned to the [b]Academy[/b] as [b]Cadets[/b].

[size=3][u][i]Cadets and Pilots[/i][/u][/size]

This tab displays a list of the Player's [b]Cadets[/b] and [b]Trained Pilots[/b]. Initially, both lists will be empty.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/personnel_initial_screen.png[/img]

[size=3][u]Hiring Cadets[/u][/size]

The Player can manually hire [b]Cadets[/b] in two ways:
[list]
[*] From the global Personnel Management screen.
[/list]
  [img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/appoint_as_cadet_from_personnel.png[/img]
[list]
[*] From the crew tab of the Player's existing ships.
[/list]
  [img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/appoint_as_cadet_from_crew.png[/img]

Use the [b]Appoint as cadet[/b] option in the context menu.

It will take some time to transfer [b]Cadets[/b] from their original location, and they will be grayed out while in transit.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/personnel_with_cadets.png[/img]

The Player can also use the context menu to manage them like any other employee.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/personnel_context_menu.png[/img]

[size=3][u]Managing Trained Pilots[/u][/size]

If auto-assign is not used, [b]Trained Pilots[/b] will return to the [b]Academy[/b].

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/personnel_with_pilots.png[/img]

The Player can then manage them in the same way as [b]Cadets[/b].

[size=3][u][i]Wings[/i][/u][/size]

All training functionality of the [b]Academy[/b] is based on [b]Wings[/b]. Each [b]Wing[/b] can contain any number of [b]Wingmen[/b]. The Player must select one ship as a [b]Wing Leader[/b] and then add any number of direct subordinates with the [b]Mimic[/b] directive.

Initially, the Player can manage 3 Wings. To increase the number of available Wings, the Player must complete the appropriate research.

To start, open the [b]Add New Wing[/b] tab.

[size=3][u]Add New Wing[/u][/size]

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/create_wing_initial_screen.png[/img]

[size=2][u][i]Primary Goal[/i][/u][/size]

First, the Player must select a [b]Primary Goal[/b] for the [b]Wing[/b]:
[list]
[*] [b]Increase Rank[/b]: Work with any faction to complete as many trade runs as possible in a given time.
[*] [b]Gain Reputation[/b]: Focus on deals with specific factions to increase reputation with them.
[/list]
[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/create_wing_select_goal.png[/img]

[size=2][u][i]Trade Data Refresh Interval[/i][/u][/size]

Since the market situation is not static, the [b]Wing Commander[/b] must re-check market data to be most effective. The Player can set a value from 5 minutes to one hour.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/create_wing_trade_refresh_interval.png[/img]

[size=2][u][i]Wing Leader Selection[/i][/u][/size]

The main part of [b]Wing[/b] creation is selecting the [b]Wing Leader[/b]. Use the appropriate dropdown, which will display all unassigned S-class ships, sorted by their pilots' ranks.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/create_wing_select_wing_leader.png[/img]

[size=2][u][i]Create the Wing[/i][/u][/size]

Simply press the [b]Create[/b] button to finalize the [b]Wing[/b] creation process.

[size=3][u]Wing Management Tab[/u][/size]

Immediately after [b]Wing[/b] creation, the current tab focus will switch to the newly created [b]Wing[/b]. The first one will be [b]Alpha[/b].

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/wing_alpha_after_creation.png[/img]

[size=2][u][i]Add Wingmen[/i][/u][/size]

The Player can add any number of [b]Wingmen[/b] to an existing [b]Wing[/b] at any time on the appropriate [b]Wing...[/b] tab using the [b]Add Wingman[/b] dropdown.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/wing_alpha_add_wingman.png[/img]

Note: It takes several seconds for an added [b]Wingman[/b] to appear in the [b]Wingmen[/b] list after selection.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/wing_alpha_with_wingman.png[/img]

[size=2][u][i]Wing Leader and Wingman Context Menus and Hotkey[/i][/u][/size]

The Player can use the standard [b]I[/b] key (or another, depending on key binding settings) to open the [b]Information[/b] window if a [b]Wing Leader[/b] or [b]Wingman[/b] is selected on the [b]Wing[/b] tab.

The same action is available via the [b]Context Menu[/b].

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/wing_leader_context_menu.png[/img]

For a [b]Wingman[/b], the [b]Remove Assignment[/b] action is also available.

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/wingman_context_menu.png[/img]

[size=3][u][i]Options[/i][/u][/size]

An options menu is available via the [b]Extension Options[/b] menu, where the Player can configure the debug level for the mod. By default, it is set to [b]No debug[/b].

[size=3][u][i]Notifications[/i][/u][/size]

Several notifications are implemented to keep the Player informed about important events related to [b]Academy[/b] operations. They will be shown in the standard notifications area (ticker):
[list]
[*] When a pilot has finished training and reached the target rank: "Pilot %s has reached the target skill level %s."
[/list]
  [img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/notifications_pilot_reached_rank.png[/img]
[list]
[*] When no free [b]Cadets[/b] are available at the academy to replace a trained pilot: "No free cadets available for pilots swapping!"
[/list]
  [img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/notifications_no_free_cadets_at_academy.png[/img]
[list]
[*] If a new [b]Cadet[/b] is hired: "Cadet %s has been hired for %s {1001,101}."
[*] If there is no free space on a ship to transfer a [b]Cadet[/b]: "No free crew capacity on %s to do pilot swapping!"
[*] When a new [b]Cadet[/b] is assigned to a Wing: "Cadet %s assigned as pilot on %s."
[/list]
  [img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/notifications_cadet_assigned.png[/img]
[list]
[*] When a [b]Trained Pilot[/b] is moved back to the academy: "Pilot %s has been moved back to Academy. You can now assign them to any new task."
[/list]
  [img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chemodun/X4-PilotAcademyRandR/refs/heads/main/docs/images/notifications_pilot_moved_back.png[/img]
[list]
[*] With [b]Auto Assign[/b], when a [b]Trained Pilot[/b] arrives on a new ship: "Pilot %s has been transferred on %s."
[*] An then on pilots swapping: "Pilot %s assigned as pilot on %s."
[*] After moving the "old" one to the [b]Academy[/b], the Player will be notified with: "Pilot %s appointed as new Academy cadet."
[*] In case of errors in [b]Cadet[/b] and [b]Trained Pilot[/b] transfers and swaps, several warning messages will be displayed:
[list]
[*] "Can't perform pilot swapping on %s! Please do it manually!"
[*] "Can't return pilot %s to the Academy! Please do it manually!"
[*] "No free capacity at Academy to return pilot %s! Please resolve it!"
